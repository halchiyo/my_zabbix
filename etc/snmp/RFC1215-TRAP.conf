EVENT coldStart .1.3.6.1.2.1.11.0.0 "Generic" Critical
FORMAT ZBXTRAP $aA にて coldStart 検知。(RFC1215-TRAP.conf) $-*
SDESC
A coldStart trap signifies that the sending
protocol entity is reinitializing itself such
that the agent's configuration or the protocol
entity implementation may be altered.

FORMAT ZBXTRAP $aA にて warmStart 検知。(RFC1215-TRAP.conf) $-*
SDESC
A warmStart trap signifies that the sending
protocol entity is reinitializing itself such
that neither the agent configuration nor the
protocol entity implementation is altered.

EVENT linkDown .1.3.6.1.2.1.11.0.2 "Generic" Major
FORMAT ZBXTRAP $aA ifIndex=$1 にて linkDown 検知。(RFC1215-TRAP.conf) $-*
SDESC
A linkDown trap signifies that the sending
protocol entity recognizes a failure in one of
the communication links represented in the
agent's configuration.
Variables:
  1: ifIndex
     Syntax="INTEGER"
     Descr="A unique value for each interface.  Its value
            ranges between 1 and the value of ifNumber.  The
            value for each interface must remain constant at
            least from one re-initialization of the entity's
            network management system to the next re-
            initialization."

FORMAT ZBXTRAP $aA ifIndex=$1 にて linkUp 検知。(RFC1215-TRAP.conf) $-*
SDESC
A linkUp trap signifies that the sending
protocol entity recognizes that one of the
communication links represented in the agent's
configuration has come up.
Variables:
  1: ifIndex
     Syntax="INTEGER"
     Descr="A unique value for each interface.  Its value

EVENT authenticationFailure .1.3.6.1.2.1.11.0.4 "LOGONLY" Warning
FORMAT ZBXTRAP $aA authenticationFailure trap 検知。(RFC1215-TRAP.conf) $-*
SDESC
An authenticationFailure trap signifies that
the sending protocol entity is the addressee
of a protocol message that is not properly
authenticated. While implementations of the
SNMP must be capable of generating this trap,
they must also be capable of suppressing the
emission of such traps via an
implementation-specific mechanism.

EVENT egpNeighborLoss .1.3.6.1.2.1.11.0.5 "IGNORE" Normal
FORMAT ZBXTRAP $aA egpNeighborLoss trap 検知。(RFC1215-TRAP.conf) $-*
SDESC
An egpNeighborLoss trap signifies that an EGP
neighbor for whom the sending protocol entity
was an EGP peer has been marked down and the
peer relationship no longer obtains.
Variables:
  1: egpNeighAddr
     Syntax="IPADDR"
     Descr="The IP address of this entry's EGP neighbor."
